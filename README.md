**Library Management System in Java**

This Java library provides classes for managing a library's collection of books, including adding, removing, retrieving, and searching capabilities. It connects to a MySQL database for persistent storage.

Features:

Book Class:
Represents a book with attributes like ID, title, and author.
Provides methods for accessing these attributes and converting a book object to a string representation.
Library Class:
Holds a list of books objects and facilitates adding, removing, retrieving all books, and finding a book by ID.
Function Class:
Handles database interactions.
Offers methods for adding a book to the database and retrieving all books from it.
DataConnection Class:
Provides a static method to establish a connection to the MySQL database using pre-defined credentials (consider environment variables).
Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
MySQL database server running
MySQL JDBC driver (included in most Java distributions)
Configuration:

Database:
Create a MySQL database named library.
Create a table named books with columns for id (INT), title (VARCHAR), and author (VARCHAR).
DataConnection:
Potentially update the connection details in DataConnection (URL, username, password) if your environment differs. However, it's highly recommended to use environment variables for credential security. Consider using a configuration file or a service like HashiCorp Vault.
Usage:

The provided code demonstrates basic library management. You can customize and integrate it into your application as needed.
Consider implementing exception handling (e.g., catching specific SQLException subclasses) for a more robust library.
