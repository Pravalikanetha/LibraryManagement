This project implements a simple library management system in Java. It provides functionalities to:

**Add books**: You can add books to the library by creating a books object and using the addBook function.
**Manage books in memory:** The Library class keeps track of books in a list, allowing you to add, remove, and find books by ID.
Access and manage books in a MySQL database: The Function class provides methods to connect to a MySQL database named "library" and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.
**View library contents**: The program demonstrates how to retrieve all books from the database and print them.
